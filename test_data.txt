Below few scenarios to test the program.

Scenario 1: X and Y data validation. Only numeric value is allowed and between 0 to 4.

PLACE X,0,NORTH 
REPORT

Output: Invalid X value!

PLACE 0,Y,NORTH 
REPORT

Output: Invalid Y value!

PLACE 5,0,NORTH 
REPORT

Output: Invalid X value!

***

Scenario 2: Cardinal Direction data validation. Only accepts NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST.

PLACE 0,0, 
REPORT

Output: Cardinal Direction cannot be empty!

PLACE 0,0,DIRECTION 
REPORT

Output: Invalid Cardinal Direction!

***

Scenario 3: Locate robot in valid location and direction

PLACE 0,0,WEST
REPORT

Output: 0,0,WEST
